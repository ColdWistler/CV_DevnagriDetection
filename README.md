# CV_DevnagriDetection
Overview

CV_DevnagriDetection is a project focused on detecting Devanagari script text, commonly used in languages such as Nepali and Hindi, within images. This capability is crucial for applications like optical character recognition (OCR), automated translation, and digital archiving of manuscripts.
# Features

    Image Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for preprocessing images to enhance text detection accuracy.
    Deep Learning: Employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and localize Devanagari characters within images.
    Jupyter Notebooks: Contains interactive notebooks that demonstrate the detection process and allow for experimentation.

# Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ColdWistler/CV_DevnagriDetection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd CV_DevnagriDetection

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'

Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

After installation, you can explore the detection capabilities using the provided Jupyter notebooks:

    Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook

    Open the NepaliTextDetection notebook: This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on detecting Devanagari text in sample images.

    Run the cells: Follow the instructions within the notebook to process images and observe the detection results.
